# django-grpc
This repository serves as a comprehensive starter kit for integrating gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) alongside Django Rest Framework (DRF) within a Django project.

Key Features:

Django Integration:
Provides seamless integration with Django, allowing developers to leverage the robust features of the Django web framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.

gRPC Support:
Incorporates gRPC, a high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call framework developed by Google. gRPC facilitates efficient communication between distributed systems, offering features such as bidirectional streaming, authentication, and automatic serialization.

Django Rest Framework (DRF):
Utilizes Django Rest Framework, a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. DRF simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs by providing serializers, viewsets, authentication, and other essential components.

Dual API Exposure:
Enables developers to expose APIs using both RESTful HTTP (via DRF) and gRPC protocols within the same Django project. This flexibility accommodates diverse client requirements and architectural preferences.

Concurrent Execution:
Implements appropriate concurrency models for running the gRPC server alongside the Django application, ensuring efficient utilization of system resources and smooth operation under varying workloads.

Code Generation:
Automates the generation of Python code from Protocol Buffer (.proto) files using grpcio-tools, simplifying the process of defining gRPC services and messages.

Sample Implementation:
Includes a sample Django app with models, serializers, and views, providing a foundation for building custom APIs tailored to specific use cases.

Disclaimer:

While efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the code and instructions provided in this repository, users are encouraged to review and test the implementation in their own environments before deploying it in production settings.
